dotOS Fan Edition Updater
=======
Simple application to download and apply OTA packages.


Server requirements
-------------------
The app sends `GET` requests to the URL defined by the `updater_server_url`
resource (or the `dotfe.updater.uri` system property) and expects as response
a JSON with the following structure:
```json
{
  "response":[
    {
      "datetime":1612459475,
      "filename":"update.zip",
      "id":"817af9b5b8eab6151c22456634c24dfe",
      "romtype":"OFFICIAL",
      "size":1666374431,
      "url":"https://url/update.zip",
      "version":"v1.0",
      "changelog":[
        {
          "miscTitle":"",
          "miscSummary":"", 
          "settingsTitle":"",
          "settingsSummary":"",
          "securityTitle":"",
          "securitySummary":"",
          "systemTitle":"",
          "systemSummary":""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `id` attribute is a string that uniquely identifies the update.
